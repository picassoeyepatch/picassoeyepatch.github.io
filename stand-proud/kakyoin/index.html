	<p>welcome to RERO RERO RERO, a character shrine for noriaki kakyoin, who is my favorite character from jojo. kakyoin is a seemingly polite but ruthless student, who joins the stardust crusaders on their mission to defeat dio. he's a quick thinker and highly capable, and apparently is somewhat adept in painting. his stand is hierophant green, and his signature move is <em>the emerald splash</em>.</p>
	<p>he has a bit of an odd appearance, but who doesn't in the world of jojo. in fact, he's almost unremarkable to his counterparts. he wears a traditional evergreen school uniform, with red, wavy hair styled in a mullet with a rogue bang that hangs in front of his face. his eyes are brown in the digital color of the manga, but lavendar in the anime. unfortunately, he is also a leo.</p>
