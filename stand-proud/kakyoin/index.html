<p><strong><center>introduction</center></strong></p>
<p>welcome to RERO RERO RERO, a character shrine for noriaki kakyoin, who is my favorite character from jojo. kakyoin is a seemingly polite but ruthless student, who joins the stardust crusaders on their mission to defeat dio. he's a quick thinker and highly capable, and apparently is somewhat adept in painting. his stand is hierophant green, and his signature move is <em>the emerald splash</em>.</p>
<p>he has a bit of an odd appearance, but who doesn't in the world of jojo. in fact, he's almost unremarkable to his counterparts. he wears a traditional evergreen school uniform, with red, wavy hair styled in a mullet with a rogue bang that hangs in front of his face. his eyes are brown in the digital color of the manga, but lavendar in the anime. unfortunately, he is also a leo.</p>

<br>
<p><strong><center>why?</center></strong></p>
<p>there's honestly a lot of reasons why kakyoin is my favorite character in all of jojo. but the most major is that i see myself in him - i relate to him quite a lot. i relate to his personality, mannerisms, and specifically his backstory. i know what's it like to be alone and have zero friends, and finding people who truly understand you is an eye opening experience. his story resonates with me, and that's why i'm so attached to him.</p>
<p>i also really like his personality - though he's often mischaracterized by the fandom as an uwu soft boy. i feel like people disregard the fact that he's actually super weird. he's a greasy gamer for crying out loud! and he made a baby eat literal shit. my favorite kakyoin quote is from that episode, by the way - "i don't care if you're a baby, i'll snap your neck like a twig!" he's really funny.</p>

<br>
<p><strong><center>queer solidarity metaphor</center></strong></p>
<p>as mentioned in the last section, i think having a stand is a metaphor for being queer/lgbt+, and the damning evidence is kakyoin's backstory, motives, and feelings about the crusaders. he's always felt out of place and different, which is a common feeling among lgbt kids. a lot of people who grew up closeted often feel like they're weird or different from others, and they shame themselves for it. until they meet other queer people, in which they begin to come to terms with their sexuality. this phenomenom has a striking similarity with kakyoin's backstory.</p>
<p>he finds a space with people like him, and they accept him wholeheartedly. they are bonded together with their common goal to defeat dio and that they have a stand. the fact that he's weird or different for having a stand is accepted and celebrated within their group, and it brings them closer together. being ostracized by society and finding a community who accepts you for who you are is an experience many lgbt+ people have gone through, and this experience is reflected through kakyoin finding the crusaders.</p>

<p>listen to these beautiful songs about kakyoin, noble pope and goodbye nostalgia by coda! noble pope is kakyoin's theme, while goodbye nostalgia is by coda, the singer of so many opening themes in jojo!! both of them are good songs, but goodbye nostalgia is pretty sad :,)</p>

<p>two absolute just friends homies!!!!!! no but really. jotakak isn't a ship with the most depth or complexity, but i just want kakyoin to be happy and to be loved and i'd like to think jotaro loves him! if i'm being honest the scene where jotaro takes the flesh bud out of kakyoin is straight out of a fanfic, it's so dramatic and even a bit romantic. the tension, jotaro trying to be stoic, why did he get on top of him? all things to consider.</p>
