	<strong>STAND PROUD : THOUGHTS</strong>
	<hr>
	<p>this is a directory for all my general analysis of jojo's bizarre adventure; one's that don't fit into a specific character shrine. i have lots of them! hope you enjoy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/stand-proud/thoughts/narrative.html">NARRATIVE FORMULA</a></li>
		<p>i discuss the very narrative of jojo and why its plot sequence is so important. i also go over unique archetypes such as a the jojo, the jobro, the jofoe, etc.</p>
		<li><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/stand-proud/thoughts/feminist.html">FEMINIST LENS</a></li>
		<p>i review jojo's bizarre adventure through a feminist lens. this is my most critical review of jojo, as i have a lot of contentions with how women are treated, viewed, and portrayed in the series. there's also a bit where i talk about how the fandom reacts and enables this.</p>
