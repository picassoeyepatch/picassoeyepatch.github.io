<h1>CHAPTER ONE: OF A NEON MOON.</h1>

<p>The sky was a swirling violet, indigo clouds painted against a dark backdrop. Terezi Pyrope gazed into that backdrop, trying to find some sort of excuse to turn back around and run back to the comfortable isolation of her hive. Trolls of varying bloods bustled among the city, illuminated by the fluorescent street and window lights. Their faces were grim and dull, a creeping smile here and there. She had never seen this many other trolls in her entire lifetime, and something about that rattled her to her core. Her blood pulsed, and her chest seemed to constrict.</p>

<p>Her eyes flicked to the train station, her grip on her ticket tightening. The train for her ship was supposed to be leaving, and she couldn’t afford to be late. There were laws to be studied and criminals to be conquered all across Her Imperious Condescenion’s very own universe. She wouldn’t be torn to pieces by a mindless drone for a simple mistake. She was quick on her feet as she made her way through the station.</p>
