<h1>CHAPTER ONE: OF A NEON MOON.</h1>

<p>The sky was a swirling violet, indigo clouds painted against a dark backdrop. Terezi Pyrope gazed into that backdrop, trying to find some sort of excuse to turn back around and run back to the comfortable isolation of her hive. Trolls of varying bloods bustled among the city, illuminated by the fluorescent street and window lights. Their faces were grim and dull, a creeping smile here and there. She had never seen this many other trolls in her entire lifetime, and something about that rattled her to her core. Her blood pulsed, and her chest seemed to constrict.</p>

<p>Her eyes flicked to the train station, her grip on her ticket tightening. The train for her ship was supposed to be leaving, and she couldn’t afford to be late. There were laws to be studied and criminals to be conquered all across Her Imperious Condescenion’s very own universe. She wouldn’t be torn to pieces by a mindless drone for a simple mistake. She was quick on her feet as she made her way through the station.</p>

<p>Terezi’s shoulders collided with other trolls, a chorus of grunts and mutters and yells erupted from the crowd waiting for their own rides. Her train was a priority. The tealblood shoved others to the side to get to her correct cart. She checked her sylladex once again. Everything was right where it needed to be, just like she had figured. She walked along the train, the machine huffing, and its insides turning. A brownblood conductor stood in front of the entrance, a sign on their breast pocket which read, “Train to The  Acatentiary Spacecraft” and Terezi knew she was in the right place. The worker accepted her ticket, muttering something she couldn’t hear among the overwhelming sounds of the area.</p>

<p>The troll staggered onto the train, adjusting a strand of hair behind her ear. She observed the aisle, filled with booths with highbloods making conversation with one another. She felt out of place among the superior personas. At least she wouldn’t be at the bottom. Rumors were floating around that the Condesce had decided to incorporate olivebloods into the system. Terezi supposed that she would need more soldiers for her army, but of course the higher army would never approve of the lowbloods tainting their perfect battalion. The olivebloods would never achieve the highest rankings, and surely wouldn’t be the top of their classes, but for some reason the Condesce found them worthy.</p>

<p>Terezi walked among the aisles, looking for an open seat but finding none.</p>

<p class="gamzee">"TeReZi PyRoPe, WhAt A pLeAsAnT mOtHeRfUcKiNg SuRpRiSe."</p>

<p>She shuddered, she could never forget that voice. She whipped around, trying to find an escape. No open seats, she had remembered. She slowly turned around to find his eyes. The indigoblood slouched in his seat, lidded eyes and dabbles of neon green in one corner of his mouth. His face paint was smeared from the consumption of sopor slime pie. Her blood went cold as he just kept staring at her. She wanted to hide.</p>

<p><span class="terezi">G4MZ33, FUNNY S331NG YOU H3R3."</span> She gave a wide, fake, toothy smile. She couldn’t turn away, she couldn’t risk him putting his hands on her again. Instead she just hoped he would change his mind and get distracted and she could run away. <span class="terezi">"1 D1DN'T KNOW YOU W3R3-"</span></p>

<p><span class="vriska">"Oh good grief, Gamzee, leave this poor girl alone,"</span> A woman rasped from only a few feet away, walking onto the cart.</p>

<p>Terezi whipped around to find a troll with an eyepatch, smudged cobalt eyeliner, and a metallic arm pointing playfully at the clown.</p>

<p><span class="gamzee">"MaN, yOu’Ve AlWaYs BeEn A mOtHeRfUcKiNg BuZzKiLl, TrYiN' tO rUiN mY fUn,"</span> Gamzee smiled, an expression that betrayed his tone of voice.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">"Can it,"</span> The troll scoffed. <span class="vriska">"And don't call me man!"</span> She walked past Terezi, a mane of matted hair tossed over her shoulders. She contorted her metal arm in an awkward position, beckoning the tealblood with a finger. She followed the unnamed girl without question, feeling the burning gaze of that foolish Gamzee on the back of her neck. She didn’t dare to turn around and meet his eyes, she wouldn’t give him power over her again.</p>

<p>She caught up with her and they walked side by side past another full cart of passengers to the  Acatentiary. She brought her to a mainly empty car, a few tealbloods and even an oliveblood waiting in empty seats. Lavender moonlight filtered in through the blinds of the train, bars of darkness between the spaces forming on the interior of the car. The girl turned around, and Terezi thought she looked almost elegant, her gray flesh shown to be a pale lavender.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">"You’re very lucky I saved you from him, and I would know, I’m very lucky,"</span>" She spoke, gesticulating with her metal arm again. <span class="vriska">"Gamzee’s a fucking asshole, and I wasn’t just gonna let him 8e mean to some random teal8lood,"</span> She rolled her working eye. Terezi nodded. She wasn’t some random tealblood, but she wasn’t going to unpack how she knew him.</p>

<p class="vriska">“You know, I feel like I know you. Like, this isn’t the first time we’re meeting. What’s your name?”</p>

<p><span class="terezi">“4ND WHY SHOULD 1 T3LL YOU?”</span> Terezi asks inquisitively.</p>

<p class="vriska">“8ecaaaaaaaause, well, why not? Am I not trustworthy, Ms. Future Legislacerator?”</p>

<p class="terezi">“1T'S T3R3Z1 PYROP3.”</p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Hm. Cool,”</span> The troll said. <span class="vriska">“I was wrong! I don’t know you. May8e I just thought of someone else! Well, I gotta go.”</span></p>

<p>She spoke, turning on her heel and leaving poor Terezi all alone again. Her eyebrows furrowed, mouth parted slightly. She had just lied right through her teeth, and she could tell. Deceit stinks, after all. She wanted to call out for her, but it was already too late, she was gone. Terezi squinted at her as she walked through the car entrance, the door swinging a few times before slamming shut, and something occurred to Terezi after the mysterious troll had disappeared. She never got her name. And the train to the Acatentiary flight began.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:#008282;background-color:#008282">

<p> </p>

<p>The flight across the Condsece’s habitual belt of stars and planets alike was only about an hour. The belt was towards the right of the empire, where the empire first began in Alternia. It was a large belt, spanning about 20 lightyears, as Terezi had retained stolen geographical books from the bookhive in her region. Her books were dated though, as opposed to the books they had at the Acatentiary.</p>

<p>The tealblooded girl sat in the lobby of the ship, and tapped her foot on the metal tiles of the ship, looking out the large window to stare into the black openness of the empire. They had just passed Silveria No. III, a planet for missions which were assigned by the Acatentiary as a part of their curriculum. Silveria No. III, which was, as the name implies, a planet with a rough, metallic gray surface with blood red rivers. There were also Silveria No. II and Silveria No. I, which were practically the same as the third Silveria with a few different key features. From rumors, she heard that the Silverias had burning moons. Their moons, like their rivers, had deep red rays that could make trolls go blind and mad. Apparently, just a sweep ago, a blueblood had gone to the first Silveria as a part of a mission, and had come back to the  Acatentiary with blind eyes and an even blinder rage.</p>

<p>Opposite the Silverias, Acatentiarlis is rather small. The  Acatentiary is smack dab in the middle of it, a towering facility on an island surrounded by pitch black waters. There’s another island by the Acatentiary, a port for incoming ships. Terezi’s ship is the last to arrive, and they need to be quick, because their scheduled orientation is in t-minus 5 hours. Knowing this makes her heart beat even faster. It’s not fear, but rather an intimidating excitement. She’s worked so hard for this; she fought like hell to get her application to the Acatentiary accepted, which is a feat not many of her caste can conquer in the empire.</p>

<p>Terezi stood up, and walked over to the vast window. The ship hovered over the Acatentiarlis Port, waiting for the fourth ship to doc so they could arrive. She bit her lip in anticipation, and studied the way the students poured out of the entrances, watching the faces of fear, pride, and all in between look to the enormous school. On Alternia, most didn’t have a proper education, as most would wait to attend this school, or were lowbloods.</p>

<p>The girl leaned up against the window as the ship landed on the port. She let out a sigh of relief as she heard the sound of gears stopping their turns, and the click of the ship on the runway. Over the intercom across the ship, the pilot calls to the students to exit in a polite and calm manner, almost like they’re a flight attendant instructing them to put on their masks as they dive and crash into the ground. Terezi nods curtly as she follows her peers out of the lobby. They go through a corridor or two before finding the exit of the ship and board off. She soon groups with the thousand students that were boarding on the last ship, no one she knew from Alternia had made it to attend the Acatentiary. Most of her past friends had been culled, or were busy with their own duties that Alternia had forced upon them, like a motherly jadeblood or a moody goldblood she knew all the way back in Alternia. She remembers them fondly, but moves on. There are other things to think about, rather than dwell on all the lost trolls from her wrigglerhood.</p>

<p>She instead focuses on a small platform near the bridge to the Acatentiary. Over the expanse of trolls, she can’t the trolls surrounding the area, but by the person standing on top of the platform, she figures that those might be her blueblood bodyguards. Terezi’s mouth parts as she stares into the lavender and golden eyes of the godlike violetblood before her. She recognizes her instantly, and her heart is pumping furiously again. It’s Sazron Pygoia, a famous scholar, privateer, and part-time legislacerator. Her conquests across the empire brought her fame in Alternia, and Terezi had admired her for her bravery and faith in justice as a legislacerator.</p>

<p>Privateer Pygoia put her clawed hand on her deep magenta trench coat, and with the other hand adjusted the hat on her head to get a better look at the students crowding around the platform. She squinted those eyes, furrowing her eyebrows into a mean grimace. Almost in a trance, Terezi walked towards the platform with the rest of her peers. A total of 5,000 enrolled students had come from the habitual belt, and it was their first day at the Acatentiary. Once the rambling of the students settles, Pygoia begins.</p>

<p><span class="sazron">“Welcome to your first day at the Acatentiary. Today will mark the start of your new life, forget your lives on your home planets because those mean nothing to you now. Here at the Acatentiary, you will be shaped into your role to fight for the empire, whether you become a privateer, legislacerator, subjugglator, or anything in between,”</span> Sazron Pygoia grunts, and points to the students, <span class="sazron">“Step out of the line, and you will be killed. Disobey Her Imperious Condescension, and you will be slaughtered. You shall devout your life to her success, as I have done with mine. Your scheduled orientation where the scholars of the Acatentiary will go through the process of your courses, and daily life here is in 4 hours, at 20:00. Do not be late or ditch the orientation. I’m sure you know what will happen to your, oh so precious life, if you decide to do any of the following.”</span></p>

<p>The crowd agrees silently, and Terezi nods once again. She smiles staring into the fierce eyes of Sazron Pygoia. She tries to dismiss Sazron and force her formal title, Privateer Pygoia, into her mind. She gets an idea. She wants the daring privateer to know of her admiration. She lacks behind in the group as they head towards the bridge, biting her chapped lips, eyes locked on her target as she flattens out her signature trench coat as she steps off the platform.</p>

<p>Terezi stopped beside the platform, and her and the privateer were staring at each other. Her eyes are narrowing at her, and she looks at her as if she is a cockroach under her foot. Something shivers through her body, and Privateer Pygoia’s devil stare makes her stomach drop. She forgets about trying to start up a conversation with her, and catches up with the rest of the students trekking across the bridge. The Acatentiary stands in the distance, with its dark, navy towers, and glistening fuschia windows. There’s marks of death lying across its walls, of teal and olive alike. It seems to expand wide, tall and bigger than Terezi could even imagine. She wonders what lies behind those walls, and what her fate with the school will be. There’s barbed wire around the tops and fences of the Acatentiary, and she wonders if it's either to keep the students in or to keep things out. Something flashes within the school that makes her want to run. Terezi doesn’t. She keeps walking.</p>

<p> </p>

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:#008282;background-color:#008282">

<p> </p>

<p>Terezi finds her room shortly before orientation so she can change into her uniform. Her dormitory is on the fourth floor where the rest of the tealbloods room. The flights up the dormitory are long and tiresome, but she gets through them. She expects her roommate to be in the room, but they’re nowhere to be found. She doesn’t quite know who she is rooming with, as there is no name scrawled on the door. Only their student ID as well as their sign. Some students don’t have signs where they come from. She gets a culture shock from this, but doesn’t question it. But still, thoughts swarm in her head. How would they be known and defined on their home planet? Just by blood color or their names?</p>

<p>Her ID number is 413. Her roommates is 414, but of course that doesn’t matter because of their absence. She huffs as she reaches the room, and rests her forehead upon the doorframe. It’s been a long afternoon, maybe she could get a nap in before the orientation, but it’s too close to 20:00. She rests her hand on the lock and turns it instinctively, to get a look at her room. It’s cramped, but clean. The recuperacoons set up in the room are not much of coons, more of a crib. She walks up to what she’s assumed is her own, and sticks her hand in the dull green liquid. It’s different from her recuperacoon on Alternia, cheaper and firm. The jelly slime substance sloshes as she pulls her hand out. She wipes it on her sweatpants.</p>

<p>Her corner of the room had a facade of coziness, but of course it was cold and damp. Her sign was plastered in teal metal above her coon, and her uniform sits on a coffee table at the end of her coon. She looks at her uniform. It’s just like the other ones, except personalized. There’s black slacks, a traditional black blazer, with her sign embroidered on her breast pocket, as well as a simple blouse. As her old clothes hit the floor, she pushes them under the coffee table, and forgets about them as soon as she can’t see them anymore. Terezi blends in with everyone else as she walks out of her dorm, fitting in with her fellow tealbloods comfortably.<br />
She passes by the windows as she heads down the stairs. A storm brews outside the Acatentiary, the sky turning a dark navy. A loud thunder can be heard, and sometimes a bright lightning blue flashes, burning into the woman’s retinas. She takes her eyes off of the outside, and instead focuses on her black leather shoes. Her laces flip around like fish, almost comically.</p>

<p>A pointy claw taps on Terezi’s shoulder, a claw that was too sharp and cold to be a troll’s. She turns around, and it’s the girl with her metal arm from the train. She’s got a mischievous grin on her face, and she’s changed into her own respective uniform, with her own little adjustments of course. Which was just her rolling up the sleeves, and wearing her pair of ratty red sneakers instead of the black dress shoes the Acatentiary had supplied.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Well hello Miss Legislacer8tor,”</span> the woman says, her fangs snaggle on her cobalt lips. In a way, it’s charming. But Terezi Pyrope, Miss Legislacerator herself, isn’t one to be charmed by silly little ceruleans with wild black hair, and teasing eyes who saved her from uncomfortable situations with a boy she used to date.</p>

<p>She avoids the pet name. <span class="terezi">“WH4T'S YOUR N4M3 4G4IN?” Terezi snaps, smiling back at the girl.</span></p>

<p><span class="vriska">“I’ll tell you soon enough,”</span> She says rather cryptically, and doesn’t look her in the eye. She storms off without a goodbye, sneaking off down the stairs, disappearing into the darkness like a spirit.</p>

<p>She lets out a sigh at the other troll's elusivity and walks down the stairs. She passes by older students walking by to get to their classes, as well as other students loitering around. The hallways of the  Acatentiary are long and a little chilly, with simple fluorescent lights illuminating them. There’s no windows to look into towards the inner part of the school, so Terezi settles for staring right in front of her. She had no idea how she’d remember how to get to her classes, or how she can even navigate this monstrous school, but she knows she’ll at least try. As Sazron Pygoia said, she had to try, or she would bite the dust with the rest of the fools who didn’t listen to the harsh instructors of the Acatentiary.</p>

<p>The auditorium, or production block as one might’ve called it on her home planet, was located near the middle north of the school. She takes her time to get there, sticking her hands in the pockets of her slacks. Soon, she’s not just surrounded by trolls of her own blood color, but instead ones of rich blues and purples. The students clog the entrance of the auditorium, all desperate to get in and find their seats.</p>

<p>Terezi gets into the vast room and surveys it. There’s many bleachers and chairs for students to sit. Stairs separate the seats. The first row was for the lowest bloods there, the olivebloods. It’s just a rusty bench for them, not polish, shine, or cushioning. The second row of seats was for the tealbloods. It’s not that better, but it’s an improvement. At least the seats for them aren’t falling apart, and they’re somewhat comfortable. And so on and so forth. The best of the best sit at the very top, the violetbloods, of course. Their seats are made of fine, deep purple wood, with soft pillows and armrests and gold accents. From the view of the stands, you could see who was at the top of the food chain and who was at the bottom. She grunts at this, feeling a bit unworthy amongst the higher castes. There’s three sets of bleachers, one in the middle, one on the right, and one of the left. Closest to her, Terezi makes her way to the left, squishing beside a few tealbloods she doesn’t know; she knows she’s soon to know them, though.</p>

<p>Privateer Pygoia stands with her colleagues on the stage. They’re making small talk, it seems, before orientation begins. The tealblood wonders if she’ll ever have a conversation with her like she wanted to when they first arrived on  Acatentiarlis. She shuts her hopes down, and her eyes wander back to the doors of the auditorium. The girl from the train arrives just in time, sticking her hand in her pocket and fiddling with something. She stares down at her metal hand with precision. Then, she sets off across the floor, passing by the olivebloods and starting up the stairs right by the left bleachers. Her jaw is clenched in a strong focus, a small little grin on her face which, yet again, stirs something in Terezi.</p>

<p>Terezi slides between the other tealbloods on the bleachers to investigate the girl’s intentions. She gets to the stairs and runs to the woman, and tugs on her metal arm to get her attention.</p>

<p><span class="terezi">“WH4T 4R3 YOU DO1NG?”</span> Terezi spits, eyebrows furrowed in interrogation.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Doing something I should’ve done a long time ago.”</span> The girl simply answers, and starts to walk faster up the stairs, hoping to shake Terezi off her tail, but she follows her. She’s passed by her own blood color’s assigned area already.</p>

<p><span class="terezi">"1F YOU'R3 DO1NG SOM3TH1NG 4G41NST TH3 3MP1R3 4ND 1TS 4G3ND4, 1 TH1NK 1'M GO1NG TO H4V3 TO STOP YOU,”</span> Terezi says like some kind of cop.</p>

<p>The suspicious girl turns around, and smiles devilishly at her. She gesticulates with her metal arm again as she speaks, <span class="vriska">“Now, why would I do that? I’m oh so loyal to the empire and its agenda, Pyrope.”</span></p>

<p>She contradicts her words as she runs up the stairs with reckless abandon, drawing a match and striking it to the bleachers which unfortunately belongs to violetbloods. A gasp comes from Pyrope’s mouth as she stares at the red and yellow flames licking at the wooden seats. The blue turns into a charred black as fire arises into the air, like angels descending into the heavens. The fire spreads just how you think it would, only spending a couple seconds in one place. It plagues the violetbloods as they screech and stand and try to escape. A certain seadweller’s rich purple cape springs to life with light, turning the regal color to a charcoal black.</p>

<p>The caped boy stood, hissing at the fire on his clothes. Every part of him seems angular, with sharp fins and even sharper teeth and wicked streaks going through his styled hair. He turns to Terezi and the mysterious girl, and then Terezi knows the girl beside her’s name.</p>

<p><span class="eridan">"vvriska serket!"</span> He shouts, pointing at the now identified cerulean standing beside Terezi. He clenched his teeth before continuing, <span class="eridan">"of fuckin' course you come here to open old wwounds."</span> He’s definitely from Alternia, with his signature seadweller accent. But Terezi supposes the term seadweller wouldn’t be appropriate here across the empire. It’s now a pointless term, since most now dwell the seas once or twice in their lifetimes, even though they don’t have the fins and capability to breath under water.</p>

<p>The fire had spread like a rumor. The stairs were burning, as well as the indigobloods’ seats. The flames tussled at Vriska’s ankles, charring the ends of her pants. She seemed unaware of this, or at least just doesn’t care. Amidst the fire, she’d been lit, her eyes reflecting a brilliant blaze, the darkness of her uniform a bright orange. She is light, and in the shadows, she springs to life like a phoenix awaking from the ashes. Terezi gets a bout of deja vu, like she’s been in the exact same place before. She shakes her head at the girl, what a fool she is.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">"Opening old wounds? I’m fucking closing them, Eridan! We should be even now, am I right?"</span> Vriska shouted over the frantic rambling of the other students. They watched with intensity and a little bit of confusion. <span class="vriska">"After all, this is pretty even considering what you did to me back on Alternia,"</span></p>

<p>Eridan grunted, and whined. <span class="eridan">"you’re a bitch, you knoww that?"</span></p>

<p class="vriska">“So I’ve been told. 8ut I’m just trying to settle this, ya know? The opposite of a 8itch!"</p>

<p>Terezi clenched her fists, she knew exactly who Vriska Serket was. These words are too familiar to forget, and suddenly she is transported back to when she was 6 sweeps old. Back when she was a little wriggler, she played FLARP to settle her boredom, although thoroughly studying Alternian law quenched it enough. She was acquaintances with this cerulean girl, and was the reason she now had a metal arm. After the whole occasion, she soon forgot of her existence, but not so much. Vriska Serket, the girl with one eye and arm, still resided at the back of her head, seeming to be still relevant even though she was a long forgotten memory in her FLARPing days.</p>

<p>She remembered her now; Vriska was an infamous, but victorious FLARP player who was violent in her wins. Her body count was well into the hundreds. She wasn’t surprised at her achievements, ceruleans were fierce but with boldness and a heart like hers she was even fiercer. The memory is hazy. She had many enemies, as she remembered, and she guessed she was one of them. Revenge had played its course, and they left each other alone before meeting each other again on the train to the Acatentiary.</p>

<p>The tealblood bursts out laughing at the situation. Not just the fire, but remembering Vriska Serket as well. It’s funny. The way that Eridan and stomping around on the flames licking at his pompous cape, and the way that cerulean just is.</p>

<p class="terezi">"VR1SK4 S3RK3T, YOU'R3 4S DUMB 4S 4 B4RKB34ST 1F YOU TH1NK 1 WOULDN'T R3M3MB3R YOU!”</p>

<p class="vriska">“Huh?”</p>

<p><span class="terezi">"1 S4ID YOU'R3 4 FUCK1NG 1D1OT FOR TRY1NG TO L13 TO M3, BUT 1 GU3SS TH4T'S JUST WH4T 1 SHOULD'V3 3XP3CT3D,"</span> Terezi repeats and lets out another cackle. The fire from below turns her sharp white teeth into a shiny yellowish orange.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Oh, Pyrope I’m just looking for a fresh start.”</span> She’s not. <span class="vriska">“I thought you knew me 8etter!”</span> Vriska laughed with her, a little bit.</p>

<p>Terezi rolls her eyes. <span class="terezi">“Y3AH R1GHT. 4S MUCH 4S YOU TRY 4ND CONV1NC3 M3 4ND OTH3R TROLLS YOU'R3 TRY1NG TO BURY TH3 H4TCH3T, BUT 4LL YOU W4NN4 DO 1S K33P SW1NG1NG 1T.”</span></p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Is that so?”</span> Vriska said, in almost a questioning way. Behind Terezi, the Privateer herself and her posse of professors trek up the bleachers, ready to beat the shit out of the firestarter.</p>

<p><span class="vriska">“Pyrope, it was nice to have a little chit-chat again, but Privateer over there is shooting daggers at me and, well, ya know…”</span> Vriska gesticulates with her good hand. Her shoes and as well as the cuffs of her slacks are charred pitch black. She waves to her old enemy before taking off, skipping steps as she disappears somewhere behind the bleachers once again.</p>

<p>It seems like she’s always running away. Terezi doesn’t know what to make of her.</p>
