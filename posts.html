<p>all my posts. some are full on essays, some are just fun stuff. enjoy! sorted from newest to oldest.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/shrines/list.html">character shrines:</a> a comprehensive list of all of my character 'shrines.' you can find my thoughts and analysis of specific characters here. includes, but is not limited to: mikan tsumiki, toko fukawa, and hell even vriska serket.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/lemondemon/spiritphone.html">spirit phone:</a> an anti-capitalist reading and analysis of lemon demon's latest album, spirit phone. i should've come up with a more interesting title for this, but alas, i don't give a fuck anymore. also all my middle school teachers that insist we come up with cool essay titles can go suck a dick, i'm naming this spirit phone because it's about SPIRIT PHONE.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/hehimlesbians.html">why he/him lesbians are valid and pronouns don't equal gender:</a> here's some food for thought: lesbians who use different pronouns than she/her. wow, what a shocker, women don't experience gender all the same. originally written a couples months ago, 4/30/20.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/posts.html">the magnum vriskus:</a> my magnum opus of my vriska serket analysis. talking about everything about her! from her likability to lesbian coding. unfortunately, i have not finished the magnum vriskus yet, so that sucks. however, you should probably check "what's new" on the home page for when i DO finish it.</p>
