<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses he/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>what's new: june 15th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>alright, so there's two things. one, i've finally finished planning my vrisjane fic and i'm halfway through the first chapter so that's pretty cool! i plan to post it on ao3, so you won't be able to view it here. however, if i do decide to move it here, i'll write about it in what's new. secondly, the what's new page. now you can view the archive of what's new. check out all the updates <a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/whatsnew">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>song of the week: the bidding by tally hall.</strong></p>
<p>not my favorite song as of late, but its pretty funky and catchy. i'm going to be honest, i don't really know the gist of the song, but it has a nice vibe. i've heard a lot about tally hall, but i haven't gotten the chance to listen to them. though, this song fucks! you can listen to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybxiMNAY35o">here (i promise it's not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>
