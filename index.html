<p><strong>about</strong></p>
<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses he/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>what's new: october 1st, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>i apologise for not updating for so long! anyway, i've recoded the "my art page." i'm going to put more art up there, but this is all i'm doing as of right now. i didn't want it to look too stylized. also, i'm keeping the song up, due to the political climate right now. see y'all on the flip side.</p>

<p><strong>song of whenever i feel like updating: the only good fascist is a very dead fascist by propagandhi.</strong></p>
<p>i've been way angrier about capitalism, fascism, and this neoliberal hell we live in now that i'm constantly inside in quarantine and alone with my thoughts. seriously though. you can listen to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBo_ijfKVRM">here (i promise it's not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>
