<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses they/shey/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>what's new: november 6th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>in celebration of destiel becoming canon and whatever the fuck is happening with the election, i updated my portfolio page! apparently i added links in there instead of just the images? that was pretty weird, it must have been in the wee hours of the morning when i did that.</p>

<p><strong>song of whenever i feel like updating: subliminal by suicidal tendencies.</strong></p>
<p>i've been listening to a lot more classic punk recently. here's one of my favorites!! i love this band, but specifically their first album, it's fantastic. i absolutely recommend suicidal tendencies (the band) to anyone who's getting into punk music. you can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxmva8FcsxA">here (i promise it's not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>
