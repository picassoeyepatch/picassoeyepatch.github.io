<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses they/shey/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, chess, etc.</p>
<p>i also like anime and manga. some of my favorites are revolutionary girl utena, perfect blue, and death note. all are absolutely fantastic, and i highly recommend those three. i'm into jojo's bizarre adventure right now, even though it's not as deep as my favorites.</p>

<p><strong>song of whenever i feel like updating: money machine by 100 gecs.</strong></p>
<p>i chose this song because it was my top song on my spotify wrapped and it's the end of the year. a really solid song, i had no idea i listened to it so much during the year though. hyperpop is such a fascinating genre, and i'm so glad it's becoming more popular. even if it's not your style, i still think you should give it a try. my favorite artists are p4rker and h3artcrush. not to mention, laura les of 100 gecs is a trans woman! which is poggers. in my opinion, i think trans people make the best hyperpop music, but i'm biased, obviously. you can listen to money machine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97qLNXeAMQ">here (not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>

<p><strong>what's new: january 3rd, 2021</strong></p>
<p>happy new years everyone! i've finished up with the noriaki kakyoin shrine, and it's complete and beautiful. i've also begun to add more icons to the graphics page, as well as slowly finishing the blog posts page.</p>
<p>2020 has been a hell of a year, and i'm glad i can go into 2021 with a new, better website layout that i actually like how it looks. also, i want to work on my essays and make them perfect just for you! anyways, i really hope this year is going to be way better than the last one (famous last words).
