<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses he/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>what's new: july 1st, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>hey! long time no see. just checking in to say that i edited two slow dancers so june isn't deadnamed and misgendered! yay!!! anyway that's pretty much it. i'm heading to iowa for the fourth of july, so don't give your hopes up for any new updates this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>song of the week: freak show by punkinloveee.</strong></p>
