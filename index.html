<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses he/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>what's new: june 10th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>i've decided to recode this whole thing! and in one night. yay. i've formatted it so it's more accessible and easier to navigate. and so that it's not so much of an old web nightmare. i mean, i think the old web aesthetic is nice, but i wanted to tone it down a notch. also, i think i'm going to try and stick with this layout since it's pretty easy to work with. check out all the updates <a href="http://www.vriskaserket.com/whatsnew">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>song of the week: soup is good food by dead kennedys.</strong></p>
<p>a song that says fuck late stage capitalism and consumer culture! i've listening to a lot more dead kennedys recently. common sense? more like communist sense! i recommend the band to anyone, really. you can listen to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WR3kziiz7g">here (i promise it's not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>
