<p>welcome to my silly little hub of projects and fanworks. i'm lee and i'm a white, nonbinary lesbian who uses they/shey/xe/vamp pronouns. i'm also a thief of breath! i like a lot of stuff, namely homestuck, but you probably caught onto that. i made this website to host my fanfiction, media analysis, theories, and whatever else i might wanna post. some of my hobbies include drawing, writing, cosplay, listening to music, chess, etc.</p>
<p>i also like anime and manga. some of my favorites are revolutionary girl utena, perfect blue, and death note. all are absolutely fantastic, and i highly recommend those three. i'm into jojo's bizarre adventure right now, even though it's not as deep as my favorites.</p>

<p><strong>song of whenever i feel like updating: money machine by 100 gecs.</strong></p>
<p>i chose this song because it was my top song on my spotify wrapped and it's the end of the year. a really solid song, i had no idea i listened to it so much during the year though. hyperpop is such a fascinating genre, and i'm so glad it's becoming more popular. even if it's not your style, i still think you should give it a try. my favorite artists are p4rker and h3artcrush. not to mention, laura les of 100 gecs is a trans woman! which is poggers. in my opinion, i think trans people make the best hyperpop music, but i'm biased, obviously. you can listen to money machine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97qLNXeAMQ">here (not a rickroll or a jumpscare).</a></p>
