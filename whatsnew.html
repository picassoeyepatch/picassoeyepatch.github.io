<p><strong>what's new: december 21st, 2020</strong></p>
<p>i've been a bit busy, and but i finished up the semester last friday so i'm going to be working on recoding this website. again. i'll be putting past pages on the web archives before i finish recoding the website.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: november 6th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>in celebration of destiel becoming canon and whatever the fuck is happening with the election, i updated my portfolio page! apparently i added links in there instead of just the images? that was pretty weird, it must have been in the wee hours of the morning when i did that.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: october 21st, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>here's the second upd8 of the month. i added my danganronpa fics to the list, however i haven't made pages for each and every one. i'll try and take care of that this weekend, since i have some time on my hands.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: october 1st, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>i apologise for not updating for so long! anyway, i've recoded the "my art page." i'm going to put more art up there, but this is all i'm doing as of right now. i didn't want it to look too stylized. also, i'm keeping the song up, due to the political climate right now. see y'all on the flip side.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: july 14th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>alright, so there was some big changes. i added a new page: my art! there's not a lot on there, and i intend to keep it that way. you can check out more of my art on my other social medias, anyways. i also decided to change the song of the week to song of whenever i feel like updating- because i don't update this website that often lol, and school's going to be starting up again soon, so i probably won't have as much time as i have now.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: july 1st, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>hey! long time no see. just checking in to say that i edited two slow dancers so june isn't deadnamed and misgendered! yay!!! anyway that's pretty much it. i'm heading to iowa for the fourth of july, so don't give your hopes up for any new updates this weekend.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: june 15th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>alright, so there's two things. one, i've finally finished planning my vrisjane fic and i'm halfway through the first chapter so that's pretty cool! i plan to post it on ao3, so you won't be able to view it here. however, if i do decide to move it here, i'll write about it in what's new. secondly, the what's new page. now you can view the archive of what's new.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>what's new: june 10th, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>i've decided to recode this whole thing! and in one night. yay. i've formatted it so it's more accessible and easier to navigate. and so that it's not so much of an old web nightmare. i mean, i think the old web aesthetic is nice, but i wanted to tone it down a notch. also, i think i'm going to try and stick with this layout since it's pretty easy to work with.</p>
