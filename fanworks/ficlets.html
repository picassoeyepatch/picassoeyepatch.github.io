<p><center><strong><u>cutesy lovey dovey crush stuff</u></strong></center></p>
<br>
  <p>Tenko’s lip trembled as she walked with the rest of her classmates from the Shrine Of Judgement. No one had said a word since they had witnessed the execution. She tried to focus her mind on something else other than the loss of her dear friend, Kirumi and Ryoma as well. Even though she thought of him as a degenerate, deep down she still missed him.</p>
  <p>“Tenko?” A tired voice asked from beside her. How could Tenko forget that cute girl?</p>
  <p>“Oh, hi Himiko.” Tenko replied and immediately blushed. She fiddled with a loose thread on her skirt, looking down at her shoes and not making eye contact with her school girl crush.</p>
<p>“I’m only going to say this once, so don’t ask me to repeat it, but um…” The mage trailed off, pushing a strand of vibrant red hair behind her ear. Tenko and Himiko’s eyes locked, and Tenko felt like she was going to melt. “Thanks for defending me back there.”</p>
<p>She tried to read the thankful girl. Was there a trace of a smile on her lip? Tenko blushed a deeper red.</p>
<p>“Anytime, Himiko.”</p>

<p>Toko groaned through her throat as Komaru failed to give up on her. She sniffled, walking around her apartment in an oversized tee shirt and sweatpants, holding the phone up to her ear. She knew her well, she’d be coming over in 10. She was too good of a friend anyway.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of you,” she said from the other side of the phone.</p>
<p>“It’s rotten work.”</p>
<p>“Not to me, not if it’s you,” Komaru said tenderly, and Toko knew she was smiling from the other line somehow. It was like a sixth sense.</p>
<p>She murmured a goodbye and hung up on her, pulling the phone away from her face and staring at it, her heart fluttering harmlessly in her chest. The boldness of her words, it astounded Toko and left her speechless. Komaru, in general, just left her speechless. She smiled fondly in remembrance of her, face feeling hot, and her hands trembling. She couldn't believe how whipped she was for this girl.</p>

<p><center><strong><u>you make me feel like a real fucking starfire</u></strong></center></p>
<br>
<p>A slit of red bled and pulsed on Miu’s hand. She was working in her lab, and accidentally cut her calloused hand working on another one of her projects late at night. She probably wasn’t supposed to be out at nighttime, but in all honesty, she really didn’t give a fuck.</p><p>The neon lights of the Ultimate Inventor’s lab seared into her eyes as her cut throbbed. Her hand was shaking ever so slightly, while her blood dribbled down the sides and creases of her palm. The tangy smell of metal from her tools and blood mingled with each other, which gave Miu a headache. She turned towards the door, clasped her hands together tight, and took off.</p><p>Miu panted as she put pressure on her wound, hurrying to the school building. She cursed her lab, which didn’t have a first aid kit. The inventor opened the door to the dining hall, which was almost pitch black. With her good hand, she felt along the wall for a light switch. She flicked them on, fluorescent lights illuminating the room.</p><p>A few plates from dinner were spread about. Upon listening closely, the clatter of the rest of the plates and dishware came from the kitchen. Miu’s eyes widen, her breath hitching. Who could be out at this time?</p><p>“Hello?” A particular maid’s voice came from the kitchen. She walked out into the open, flattening out her skirt with her hands. Brightened by the darkness as well as the light, she looked almost regal with her slightly disheveled look. Kirumi must have been cleaning all night after dinner time.</p><p>Miu could only stare, dazed from how absolutely gorgeous Kirumi was. The maid gasped in shock at her hand, blood leaving tiny puddles on the floor, and walked over to her to get a better look at the cut.</p><p>“Oh dear,” Kirumi said, squinting at her hand before looking back up at Miu. “Go sit down and I’ll clean you up, mhm?”</p><p>Miu snapped out of it, “It’s fine, I can fucking take care it of myself,” she whispered softly, not a single drop of hostility in her voice.</p><p>“Oh no, no, I’ll take care of it.” Kirumi promised and it was final.</p><p>She took her gently by her uncut hand, and sat her down at the dining table. Kirumi assured her to put pressure on it, while she went into the kitchen to acquire bandages. She came back with a first aid kit, and sat in the seat next to her.</p><p>It was a quiet night and the only sound seemed to be the beating of each other’s hearts and their soft breaths. Kirumi worked diligently with her hands to patch up the other girl. And Miu blushed at her tender touch, holding her gingerly.</p><p>Kirumi finished wrapping her hand, securing the bandage and giving it a little kiss, “There, all better.” She murmured, still hand in hand, and Miu was glad she wouldn’t let it go. The ghost of her lips rested on the back of her hand, and she missed them.</p><p>It was a moment Miu would be thinking about for the next couple of nights. She laid in bed, staring at the wall, unable, wondering why she was feeling such gentleness in her heart when she thought of that time, something arousing in her, though it was not sexual at all.</p>
